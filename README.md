To use this click on the Spell Prep icon (the star) on the character sheet title bar.

Each spell that can be prepared will have a checkbox. Spells that cannot be prepared (at-will, innate, always prepared and pact magic) will be included in the spell list, marked by their type.

A count of the number of spells that have been prepared and the maximum number that can be prepared is displayed at the top of the dialog box for each class that prepares spells.

If the character can cast spells with multiple classes, you'll need to categorize each spell with the class. A drop-downl list box is provided for each prepared spell to indicate this.
